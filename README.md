# BJAD CODING GRAMMAR

Distinguish built in functions vs homemade functions add BJAD to the end of the function or object name:

example: const playerLoaderBJAD = () => {
  ...//this would be a homemade function.
}

const mapBJAD = {
  playerId: 1...
  // this would be a homemade object.
}

Distinguish local vs remote actions using REC_REM and SND_REM

Use folders for each lifecycle component. This requires us to set up webpack.
